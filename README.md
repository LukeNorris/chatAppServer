This is a code repository for the serverside app corresponding Youtube video tutorial from  [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwFA3YMfkoc).

It is a Realtime Chat Application, using React on the front end, with NodeJS + Socket.io web socket library on the back end.

This server is hosted on Heroku
The client is hosted seperatly on Netlify and the respositry for this is public available on my profile page

You can send and receive messages using web sockets and Socket.io to make any real-time application.

Setup:

run npm i && npm start for both client and server side to start the development server

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
